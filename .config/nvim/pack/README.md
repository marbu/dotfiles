# Neovim Plugins

Yes, with [neovim](https://neovim.io/) you can still use [pack
path](https://neovim.io/doc/user/pack.html) to
[install plugins without a plugin manager](https://vonheikemen.github.io/devlog/tools/installing-neovim-plugins-without-a-plugin-manager/).

The plugins are included as [git
submodules](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitsubmodules.html).

Why? I don't like dynamic magic in my configuration and dependency management.
