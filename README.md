# Dotfiles

This repository contains dotfiles which I find most important (would
like to have on any unix system I have an account on).

## Usage

I wrote simple command line tool called [dogit](https://github.com/marbu/dogit)
for management of dotfile repositories and that is the only way I work with
this dotfiles repository.

That said you don't need any tool to make sense of it as format of this
repository is quite simple. Working tree of the repo represents a home
directory, so no additional file transformations are needed with an exception
of removing this README file.
