# Dotfiles

This repository contains dotfiles which I find most important (would
like to have on any unix system I have an account on).

## Usage

For management of dotfile repositories, I wrote (so far quite simple)
tool [gidot](https://github.com/marbu/gidot).

That said, format of this repository is simple: the working tree of the
repo represents a home directory, so no additional file transformations
are needed (with an exception of removing this README file)

## Note

Usually when a dotfile repository is cloned, the first thing you do is to remove
this README file (so first commit in a local branch is the readme deletion).
